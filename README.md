## Variants

There are a number of Agentic frameworks out there. I am attempting to maintain this project to work
both under [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable//index.html) and
[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/). The main project will
be developed on AutoGen, with some features being ported to the Semantic Kernel branch as time and framework
capabilities permit.

The `main` branch will be using AutoGen.

To see the Semantic Kernel implementation, use the [`semantic-kernel-port`](https://github.com/ckane/ctigor/tree/semantic-kernel-port)
branch.
